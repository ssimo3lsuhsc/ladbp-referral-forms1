        <p>Dear Parents/Guardian:</p>
        <p>Thank you for enrolling your child with the <b class="ladbp">Louisiana DeafBlind Project for Children and Youth.</b> Students qualify for inclusion in the <b class="ladbp">Project</b>'s work when they present with concomitant, permanent hearing and vision impairment resulting in communication, developmental and/or educational needs that cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for children with deafness or children with blindness.</p>
        <p>Verification regarding your child’s hearing and vision impairment is required.  Also, verification of your child’s need for special education services is required.  These verifications can be accomplished by providing the <dfn class="ladbp">Project</dfn> copies of hearing evaluations, vision evaluations, educational evaluations, Individual Education Plan (IEP) or Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP).  All information regarding your child is held in confidence.</p>
        <p>Personal education and healthcare information is protected by Federal laws including the 
            <dfn>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</dfn> and the 
            <dfn>Health Information Privacy and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</dfn> These laws make sure your child’s educational &amp; health information is kept private and requires that we give you notice of our legal duties and privacy practices.  Included in this packet of information is a 
            <dfn>Notice of Privacy Practices Protected Health Information</dfn> which details our obligations under HIPAA. Please review this document.  Once reviewed, please complete the 
            <dfn>Acknowledgment of Receipt of Notice of Privacy Practices</dfn> form and return it to the Louisiana DeafBlind Project along with the other application materials. <em class="font-bold">It is not necessary to include the Notice in the final application.</em> The following check-list may assist you in organizing the needed information for your child.

        <h2>Notice of Privacy Practices Regarding Your Protected Health Information</h2>
        <p><strong>This Notice Describes How Medical/Dental Information About You May Be Used and Disclosed and How You Can Get Access to This Information. Please Review It CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
        <p>The law requires us to make sure your medical information is kept private. It also requires us to give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices to tell you what we can do with the medical information about you. To better understand this law, you may want to read it. It is in Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 164. In the unlikely event that the information we have about you should be obtained by someone who is not supposed to have it, the law requires us to notify you. We are required to follow the practices outlined in this notice. We have the right to change this notice and our privacy practices in the future. Any changes made will apply to all of the medical information we have about you at this time. If we make a change, we will put up a notice in our building. We will also give you a copy of the new notice if you ask for it. You can also read about these changes on the computer at this website:<a href="https://www.lsuhsc.edu/">www.lsuhsc.edu</a></p>

            <h3>How Your Medical/Dental Information May Be Used</h3>
            <p>In general, we may use your medical information in a number of ways:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>To provide patient care to you.</dt>
                <dd>Your medical information may be used by the doctors, nurses and other professionals who are treating you. For example, your medical information is used to help them find out your problems or condition, and to decide the best way to treat you. Also, we may use your medical information to contact you to remind you of appointments, and to give you information about other treatment options or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.</dd>
                <dt>To obtain payment.</dt>
                <dd>Your medical information may also be used by our business office to prepare your bill and process payments from you as well as from any insurance company, government program or other person who is responsible for payment. Also, we may use your medical information to raise funds for our organization.</dd>
                <dt>For our health care operations.</dt>
                <dd>Your medical information may be used to review the quality and appropriateness of the care you receive. We may also use your medical information to put together information to see how we are doing and to make improvements in the services and care we give you. In some cases we may have students, trainees, or other health care personnel, as well as some non-health care personnel, who come to our facility to learn under the guidance of faculty to practice or improve their skills. Also, we may use your medical information to raise funds for our organization through an institutionally related foundation or business associate.</dd>
                <dt>To create de-identified databases.</dt>
                <dd>We may use your medical information for the purpose of removing information that tells anyone who you are, and putting it in a computer program. Your information may be completely de-identified or partially de-identified. This information is often used for research purposes. If your information is partially de-identified, it is called a “limited data set.”</dd>

            <h3>Objections to Use and Disclosures</h3>
            <p>In certain situations, you have the right to object before your medical information can be used or revealed.

            <dl>
                <dt>Patient Directory.</dt>
                <dd>In most cases, this means your name, room number, and general information about your condition may be given to people who ask for you by name. Also, information about your religion may be given to members of the clergy, even if they do not ask for you by name.</dd>

            <h3>Other Rights Regarding Your Medical/Dental Information</h3>
            <p>You may also have the following rights regarding your medical information:</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to ask us to treat your medical information in a special way, different from what we normally do. Unless you have the right to object to the use of the information, we do not have to agree with you. If we do agree to your wishes, we have to follow your wishes until we tell you that we will no longer do so.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to tell us how you would like us to send your information to you. For example, you might want us to call you only at work or only at home. Or you may not want us to call you at all. If your request is reasonable, we must follow your request.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to look at your medical information and, if you want, to get a copy of it. We can charge you for a copy, but only a reasonable amount. Your right to look at and copy your medical records is based upon certain rules. For example, we can ask you to make your request in writing, or, if you come in person, that you do so at certain times of the day.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to ask us to change your medical information. For example, if you think we made a mistake in writing down what you said about when you began to feel bad, you can tell us. If we do not agree to change your record, we will tell you why, in writing, and give you information about your rights.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to be told to whom we have given your medical information in the six years before you ask. This does not apply to all disclosures. For example, if we gave someone your medical information so that they could treat you or pay for your care, we do not have to keep a record of that.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to get a copy of this notice at no charge.</p>
            <p><strong>You have the right</strong> to complain to us or to the United States Department of Health and Human Services if you believe that we have violated your privacy rights.</p>
